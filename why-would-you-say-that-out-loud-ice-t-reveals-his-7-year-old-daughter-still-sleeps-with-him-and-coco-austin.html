So it was presents over presence. I wasn’t there.”</p><p>Ice-T shares his firstborn with Adrienne Marrow.&nbsp;</p><p>He continued explaining that his son was born while he was “distracted” by his growing career as a rapper.&nbsp;</p><p>“You know I ain’t never been famous before, this was a whole new thing. So I’m distracted by that,” the 65-year-old said.&nbsp;</p><p>During the mid-’80s, Ice-T and singer Darlene Otiz were a power couple within the hip-hop community before he received a record deal. During their relationship, Tracy Jr. was born.&nbsp;</p><p>The “New Jack Hustler” rapper became a father to Chanel when he was 57 years old and while he was an already seasoned vet in the rap industry. Though he wasn’t as active as he should’ve been while raising his elder children, Ice-T’s now relaxed lifestyle has given him the luxury of fully experiencing fatherhood.&nbsp;</p><p>“I’m comfortable, I’m in a cruise pattern. I was there when Coco was pregnant, I went to the hospital, and Chanel still sleeps in the bed with us,” He said. “I’m so much more connected to her than my other kids.”&nbsp;</p><p>Austin gave birth to her only daughter on Nov. 28, 2015, when she was 44 years old.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I wake up every morning with 3 girls….. lol <a href=#>#TheIceFamily</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/v87QJYl2R3</a></p>— ICE T (@FINALLEVEL) <a href=#>January 28, 2019</a></figure><p>Though Ice-T was speaking his truth, some fans <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">responded</a> to his statement under The Shade Room’s Instagram post by suggesting that the “Law and Order: SVU” actor should’ve chosen his words more carefully to avoid potentially hurting his older children’s feelings.&nbsp;</p><p>“Let’s normalize saying things that won’t have children from previous relationships feel slighted.”</p><p>“Bc he’s older and more mature. It happens. Sucks for the other kids (i can relate), but nice for their little sister.”</p><p>“Now why would you say that out loud Ain even know this man had other kids”&nbsp;</p><p>While a few have shared their concerns, Ice-T stated that having a child during the second half of a person’s life is a “reset,” which he considers to be “a beautiful thing.”&nbsp;</p><p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">In a previous interview </a>on V-103’s “The Big Tigger Morning Show,” Ice-T confessed that having a daughter at his age reactivated his life.&nbsp;</p><p>“I got back healthy,” he admitted. “I’m now back in the gym, I’m looking good, sharp, I’m strong – I gotta live. I can’t go anywhere. I gotta keep chasing these bags, you know what I’m saying? I got a baby girl.”&nbsp;</p><p>Elsewhere in the conversation, Ice-T revealed his daughter’s desire to have a career as a doctor. The Marrows are always sharing <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">funky videos together</a> via Instagram or TikTok.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpKGur8DAm6Oam5uowaK%2BjZympmdiZX90e49uZmpoX6y1unnWqKylnF2uvLZ50pqwZqyYlsFuu9StZKWnpZl6qq%2FEZqtmqpWrsqK40mafoqtdbHq6scCrZKiklGKxosHGoaueql2owaq4y2aqpZ2VpcBuw8itn2agmaJ6orrDZpqom59irra%2F06KlaA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwhy-would-you-say-that-out-loud-ice-t-reveals-his-7-year-old-daughter-still-sleeps-with-him-and-coco-austin.html&text=This%20Man%20Had%20Other%20Kids%3a%20Ice-T%20and%20Coco%20Austins%207-Year-Old%20Daughter%20Still%20Sleeps%20In%20the%20Bed&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwhy-would-you-say-that-out-loud-ice-t-reveals-his-7-year-old-daughter-still-sleeps-with-him-and-coco-austin.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-would-you-say-that-out-loud-ice-t-reveals-his-7-year-old-daughter-still-sleeps-with-him-and-coco-austin.html&title=This%20Man%20Had%20Other%20Kids%3a%20Ice-T%20and%20Coco%20Austins%207-Year-Old%20Daughter%20Still%20Sleeps%20In%20the%20Bed" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwhy-would-you-say-that-out-loud-ice-t-reveals-his-7-year-old-daughter-still-sleeps-with-him-and-coco-austin.html&title=This%20Man%20Had%20Other%20Kids%3a%20Ice-T%20and%20Coco%20Austins%207-Year-Old%20Daughter%20Still%20Sleeps%20In%20the%20Bed" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwhy-would-you-say-that-out-loud-ice-t-reveals-his-7-year-old-daughter-still-sleeps-with-him-and-coco-austin.html&title=This%20Man%20Had%20Other%20Kids%3a%20Ice-T%20and%20Coco%20Austins%207-Year-Old%20Daughter%20Still%20Sleeps%20In%20the%20Bed" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwhy-would-you-say-that-out-loud-ice-t-reveals-his-7-year-old-daughter-still-sleeps-with-him-and-coco-austin.html&description=This%20Man%20Had%20Other%20Kids%3a%20Ice-T%20and%20Coco%20Austins%207-Year-Old%20Daughter%20Still%20Sleeps%20In%20the%20Bed" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./barbecue-briquette-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Barbecue briquette">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./victoria-potter.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Victoria Potter Net Worth, Age, Height, Bio, Birthday, Wiki!">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
