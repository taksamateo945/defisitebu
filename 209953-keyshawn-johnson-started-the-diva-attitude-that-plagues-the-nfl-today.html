His outrageous remarks during the 2003 season caused an argument on the sideline with Jon Gruden that was seen by millions of people, this caused Gruden to deactivate Johnson for the remainder of the season until he was then traded to the Cowboys.</p><p>Another memorable off-field moment was in 2004 when Johnson called out former Bucs teammate Ronde Barber and referred to him as "Uncle Tom."</p><p>These are just a few of the most memorable moments of Johnson being a diva and there are plenty to other moments including excessive fines, throwing down his helmet during games (which was the result of the NFL creating a new rule), and just showing his cocky attitude throughout various games.</p><p>Johnson even commented on his paving the path of diva receivers by saying, "[In 1996,]I was the queen of the ball, the princess, whatever. And all those guys have come after me."</p><p>"I wrote the book on diva receivers. Truly, when you break it all down, I'm the first guy in the last 15 years of receivers who did all that stuff. I threw my helmet to the ground when no one was doing that."</p><p>Now we have to deal with TO overdosing, Braylon Edwards calling out the Browns fans, Brandon Marshall and his off the field issues, Ochocinco running his mouth and making predictions, Matt Jones partying way too hard with illegal drugs, Donte' Stallworth drunk driving and killing a man, and <a href=#>Plaxico Burress</a> shooting himself in the leg.</p><p>The diva attitude needs to stop.</p><p>Why can't these guys take notes from <a href=#>Randy Moss</a> on how to grow up, mature, and stay out of trouble? (Moss wasn't an angel earlier in his life.)</p><p>It's a shame these guys think they can get away with their attitudes, because NFL commissioner Roger Goodell is about to lay down some law with some pending suspensions that look to be extremely lengthy. Hopefully, Goodell can stop this ridiculous circus sooner than later.</p><p>Thanks, Keyshawn; thanks a lot.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaWlxaWqAbrfEsqqhmaejequ7x6eqqKZdqMGivtOem2asmJp6pbXVmmSarKSewbawxGaroZmkYr2trcaunKxlpJ2ybrrFpWStp5SWxg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f209953-keyshawn-johnson-started-the-diva-attitude-that-plagues-the-nfl-today.html&text=Keyshawn%20Johnson%20Started%20the%20Diva%20Attitude%20That%20Plagues%20the%20NFL%20Today%20%7c%20News%2c%20Scores%2c%20Highlights%2c%20St&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f209953-keyshawn-johnson-started-the-diva-attitude-that-plagues-the-nfl-today.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f209953-keyshawn-johnson-started-the-diva-attitude-that-plagues-the-nfl-today.html&title=Keyshawn%20Johnson%20Started%20the%20Diva%20Attitude%20That%20Plagues%20the%20NFL%20Today%20%7c%20News%2c%20Scores%2c%20Highlights%2c%20St" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f209953-keyshawn-johnson-started-the-diva-attitude-that-plagues-the-nfl-today.html&title=Keyshawn%20Johnson%20Started%20the%20Diva%20Attitude%20That%20Plagues%20the%20NFL%20Today%20%7c%20News%2c%20Scores%2c%20Highlights%2c%20St" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f209953-keyshawn-johnson-started-the-diva-attitude-that-plagues-the-nfl-today.html&title=Keyshawn%20Johnson%20Started%20the%20Diva%20Attitude%20That%20Plagues%20the%20NFL%20Today%20%7c%20News%2c%20Scores%2c%20Highlights%2c%20St" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f209953-keyshawn-johnson-started-the-diva-attitude-that-plagues-the-nfl-today.html&description=Keyshawn%20Johnson%20Started%20the%20Diva%20Attitude%20That%20Plagues%20the%20NFL%20Today%20%7c%20News%2c%20Scores%2c%20Highlights%2c%20St" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./the-masked-singer-season-10-episode-10-recap-husky-tiki-revealed.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="'The Masked Singer' Season 10, Episode 10 Recap: Husky, Tiki Revealed">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./under-oath-who-is-ken-griffin-lied-is-he-going-to-jail-net-worth-2021.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who Is Hedge Fund Billionaire Ken Griffin?
