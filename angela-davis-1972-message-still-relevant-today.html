I reached out to them and was surprised and excited to learn that prior to the pandemic, the footage had been on display in the library. Apparently, I was not the first to notice how much of what Ms. Davis says in her speech resonates with the present.”</p><p>In the speech, Davis spoke of the problems of economic inequality, a divided society and rising fascism.&nbsp; She took great pains to speak not of only Black people, but of all people — brown, white, black and all shades between — noting that injustice and racism hurts all of us.</p><p>The words from the past spoke deeply to Faulk. “For a young Black man trying to make his way in this crazy world, Ms. Davis is an icon, a living legend,” he said. “To see her, at 28 years old, just months after being released from prison, speaking truth to power in a room full of her peers, is nothing short of inspiring. It made me realize that all of the young&nbsp;activists of today are truly standing on the shoulders of giants.”</p><p>“Some might be disheartened that we are continuing to fight against&nbsp;the same forces of oppression and repression that activists in the United States&nbsp;were 50 years ago,” said Faulk. “I found it empowering to know that we come from a long history of people that found the courage to stand up for the humanity of the oppressed, and to do so in ways that were rooted in love.”</p><p>Co-host Malone said she hoped other CSUF students will be just as inspired. “I hope students will leave this event inspired and empowered to continue resisting systems of oppression and speaking out about social injustice, even when or perhaps, especially when it’s unpopular. I hope Angela Davis’ courage is contagious,” said Malone.</p><p>“I also hope students will feel guided to think outside the box and dare to dream of new and radical possibilities for society and push past the limitations of reform,” Malone continued. “I hope students and other attendees will take it upon themselves to study her work, read her books and apply her critical wisdom to our ongoing struggle for a more humane, compassionate and peaceful world.”</p><h4>Black History Month Events at CSUF</h4><p>CSUF is rounding out Black History Month with events throughout the rest of February. Here are some highlights. For more information and more events, see CSUF’s African American Studies web page, http://bit.ly/CSUFBlackHistory.</p><p><strong>The Freedom of Our Hair</strong></p><p>Monday, 3-4 p.m.</p><p>What’s in a mane? Join Gwendolyn Alexis, a CSUF lecturer in the African-American Studies Department, to look “at our hair journey, and the freedom we have to wear our hair in any style we chose.”</p><p>Zoom ID: 85153034897</p><p><strong>Critical Consciousness: Protest & Dissent</strong></p><p>Tuesday, 1-2:30 p.m.</p><p>A community discussion on Protest & Dissent, highlighting the attack at the nation’s capitol and focusing on the experiences of marginalized folks.</p><p>Zoom ID: 82009787637</p><p><strong>Between Roots and Routes: Strategies for Researching African Diasporic Family Histories and the Power of Place</strong></p><p>Feb. 25, 4-6 p.m.</p><p>This event will showcase key record collections, tools, and strategies for tracing African Diasporic ancestry in the U.S. In particular, it highlights how genealogy databases and research methods, and improved digital literacy skills can help scholars, students, and family historians overcome challenges that are unique to researching the African American past. It also considers how the forced, voluntary, and induced migrations of African Diasporic peoples throughout the Americas have contributed to unique place-based communities that can also aid in recovering lost or unknown family histories.</p><p>Register at <a href=#>http://bit.ly/CSUFPowerOfPlace</a></p><p><a href=#>This post first appeared on ocregister.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnkaO0prjAZpuarpmoenKFlmtkpp2jqK6osYysq6KknGK%2FprjEr5inrF2pvKWt2Gg%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fangela-davis-1972-message-still-relevant-today.html&text=Angela%20Davis%201972%20message%20still%20relevant%20today&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fangela-davis-1972-message-still-relevant-today.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fangela-davis-1972-message-still-relevant-today.html&title=Angela%20Davis%201972%20message%20still%20relevant%20today" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fangela-davis-1972-message-still-relevant-today.html&title=Angela%20Davis%201972%20message%20still%20relevant%20today" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fangela-davis-1972-message-still-relevant-today.html&title=Angela%20Davis%201972%20message%20still%20relevant%20today" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fangela-davis-1972-message-still-relevant-today.html&description=Angela%20Davis%201972%20message%20still%20relevant%20today" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./id-worn-by-a-pup-2-wds-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="ID worn by a pup: 2 wds.">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./5sos-fans-react-ripashtonshair.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="5SOS Fans React: #ripAshtonsHair - CelebMix">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
