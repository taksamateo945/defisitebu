The industry that is a subset of Nollywood has produced tons of wealthy actresses and their net worth shows how rich the Yoruba movie industry is. Though many of these actresses make a lot of money nowadays doing other things aside from acting, a good number of them primarily became rich and famous as Yoruba film actresses. Having grown and shown in the spotlight, some now earn money as brand ambassadors for companies, while others have numerous and successful businesses. Below are the top ten richest Yoruba actresses in Nigeria, with a quick review of their acting careers and their other known sources of income.</p><h2><strong>The Richest Yoruba Actresses as Determined by Their Net Worth</strong></h2><h3><b>1. Bukunmi Oluwasina Grace</b></h3><ul><li><span><strong>Net Worth</strong>: $60,000 (estimated) about N25 million</span></li><li><strong>Day of birth</strong>: May 7th</li><li><span><strong>Active Years</strong>: 2015 to date</span></li><li><span><strong>Other Main Sources of income</strong>: Scriptwriting and Brand Sponsorships</span></li><li><span><strong>Best Known For</strong>: </span><i><span>Ayomi</span></i><span> (2015)</span></li></ul><p>Bukunmi Oluwasina Grace is a young and fast-rising wealthy actress who hails from Oke-Imesi, Ekiti State. She is the third born of a family of seven. The Yoruba actress is a graduate of the Department of Theatre Arts, Obafemi Awolowo University, and rightly so, she started her career acting quite early and it was during her final year in the university that she made the movie Ayomi featuring Joke Muyiwa, <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Gabriel Afolayan</a>, Damola Olatunji. Ayomi happened to be her debut movie and till today still stands out as one of her best works.</p><p>The actress has since then starred in a good number of Yoruba and English Nollywood movies like Excursion, Modebi Olami, Test, Citation and so much more. While as a movie scriptwriter, she has credit for having written movies like Mine, Oluwere, Eje Ibi, with more to come. With these acting works, she has helped herself to a net worth of about $60,000 to show how good she is in the industry.</p><h4><b>Other Sources of Income of Bukunmi Oluwasina Grace</b></h4><p>As it is common with actresses in Nollywood, Bukunmi has invested in the industry and also leveraged the good image she has built up as a fan favorite to add to her already fat bank account. She has endorsed a couple of business brands which she is believed to have earned from.</p><ul><li><strong>Scriptwriting</strong></li></ul><p>Like many of her counterparts in the industry, Bukunmi also earns money from scriptwriting in Nollywood aside from what she gets paid as an actress. Some of the movies she has written include Itan Temi, A story like Mine, Oluwere, and Beautiful Song. However, with the dearth of financial information about film production in Nollywood, the actresses cut from these productions were not publicized.</p><ul><li><strong>Lady Miami Clothing and Posh Glow Skincare</strong></li></ul><p>In 2020, the Obafemi Awolowo University graduate of dramatic arts <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>reportedly signed two endorsement deals</a> in a space of two days. One with Lady Miami Clothing and the other with Posh Glow Skincare which is owned by Skincare expert, Yeye Folasade Omotoyinbo. Though the details of these deals were not and have not been made public, it is safe to believe that the talented actress pocketed a deserving huge amount of money seeing how successful the brands have grown since her signing with them.</p><h3><b>2. Ronke Odusanya</b></h3><ul><li><span><strong>Net Worth</strong>: $100,000 (estimated) about N41 million</span></li><li><strong>Date of Birth</strong>: 3 May 1973</li><li><span><strong>Age</strong>: 50 years old</span></li><li><span><strong>Active Years</strong>: 2000 till date</span></li><li><span><strong>Other Sources of Income</strong>: Movie Production, Brand Ambassador, and Social Media Influencer</span></li><li><span><strong>Best Known For:</strong>&nbsp;Folake (2006)</span></li></ul><p>The shapely actress nicknamed Flakky Ididowo is another influential and wealthy Yoruba actress.

She got the nickname Flakky Ididowo from the role she played in <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Faitha Balogun</a>‘s movie, Folake.</p><p>Seeing how talented she is and the good number of works she has starred in, it is easy to see why the talented Yoruba actress has earned as much as $100,000. Aside from having made money from acting, Ronke also has a good number of awards to show off. She was nominated for Best Actress in a Leading Role (Yoruba) at the Best of Nollywood Awards 2017 for her role in the movie, Ailatunse.</p><h4><strong>Ronke Odusanya Smiles to the Bank From These Other Sources</strong></h4><p>From brand endorsements for herself to an acting school, the talented Ronke Odusanya pockets a good amount of money with her image as a popular actress and a fan favorite.

Ronke put pen to paper with the company in October 2020 as a move by the company to use her image to promote its presence in the real estate sector of the Nigerian economy. However, though it is not known how much it cost the company to secure her services, Ronke is perhaps happy with the deal as she has been seen severally promoting the company on social media.</p><ul><li><strong>Kimdivaztouch Organic Skincare</strong></li></ul><p>As it is common with many actresses in and outside of Nollywood, Ronke Odusanya has not been left without an endorsement deal from a skincare company. Her’s is with Kimdivaztouch Organic Skincare which according to their Insta bio, is an Ekiti State-based company that makes 100% organic skin products it ships nationwide. The actress who is in every word a beautiful woman regularly promotes the company’s products on her social media pages where her fans regularly engage with her.</p><ul><li><strong>Ronnies School of Performing Arts</strong></li></ul><p>Back to where it started, Ronke has equally invested in Nollywood and of course, makes money off her acting school which she aptly named Ronnies School of Performing Arts.</p><h3><b>3. Iyabo Ojo</b></h3><ul><li><span><strong>Net Worth</strong>: $307,000 (estimated) about N126 million</span></li><li><strong>Date of Birth</strong>: 21 December 1977</li><li><strong>Age</strong>: 46 years old</li><li><span><strong>Active Year</strong>s: 1998 till date</span></li><li><span><strong>Other Sources of Income</strong>: Event Planning and Catering, Spa Business, and Movie Production.</span></li><li><span><strong>Best Known For</strong>: Silence (2015)</span></li></ul><p><span><a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Iyabo Ojo</a> is no doubt one of the richest Yoruba actresses who grew to where she is now with a dint of hard work. The talented actress who is from Abeokuta, Ogun State was born on 21st, December 1977 into a family of 5. She had her elementary education in Lagos and later on studied Estate Management at Lagos State Polytechnic. </span>She subsequently began her acting career in 1998 after joining the Actors Guild of Nigeria (AGN).</p><p>In 2002, Iyabo made her debut in a Yoruba movie titled Darijinwon and since then she has acted in about a hundred films such as Satanic, Okanla, Silence, Tori Ife, Ipadabo, etc. Iyabo Ojo has also produced several films which include Bolutife, Bofeboko, Ololufe, Esan.

She is known to have purchased a luxurious mansion in the Lekki area of Lagos. Iyabo is also known to be a brand ambassador of Pragmatic Homes which is a real estate company in Nigeria.</p><h3><b>4.

She attended Community Grammar School Ibadan for her primary education before she went to Lagos where she had her secondary education.

From 2003 till now, she has been featured in numerous Yoruba movies to which she has been well paid for and also earned her a place among the richest Yoruba actresses. She’s best known to interpret roles that show jealousy and strife satisfactorily. Mide has acted in movies like Akoba Obirin, Arewa, Ipinle Mi, and lots more. The movie, Omo Oku Orun, brought her prominence in the industry and she won a few awards such as the Yoruba Movie Gist Award for Best Supporting Actress (2020), City People Movie Award for Best Actress of the Year (Yoruba), and City People Best Supporting Actress of the Year (Yoruba).</p><h4><strong>Different Income Sources that Add to Mide’s $400,000 Net Worth</strong></h4><p>Though acting is her claim to fame and wealth, Mide has diversified her income sources to include non-acting sources which range from modeling to brand endorsements and sponsorships.</p><ul><li><strong>Brand Endorsement Deals</strong></li></ul><p>Back in 2014, Mide Funmi Martins had cause to smile when she signed a brand endorsement deal with a real estate company – Katawa Properties. The deal to which she put pen to paper was at the time reported to be running into millions of naira and she was pretty excited about it.</p><p>Aside from the real estate firm, the actress has also endorsed brands like OSEDUDU WORLD which is a skincare company, Fatil Luxury which offers a weight loss supplement, and Philly Boutique Nigeria. From the look of things, it appears to be that the actress doesn’t only endorses these brands but perhaps also owns the businesses.</p><ul><li><strong>Modeling and Clothing Line</strong></li></ul><p>As a pretty woman, it is easy to see why Mide Funmi Martins earns from modeling and a clothing line she owns. She owns and runs an online women’s luxury fashion line called Myde Luxury Attires.</p><ul><li><strong>Movie Production</strong></li></ul><p>Mide has also shown that she is not only talented in acting but also equally talented in movie production.

She put pen to paper with Glaxosmithkline to promote one of their products; Ribena, a popular fruit drink in Nigeria targeted at children. Though how much she earned from this deal at the time is not known, but seeing that GlaxoSmithKline is a British multinational pharmaceutical company valued at $28 billion currently and with significant business interest in Nigeria, the actress no doubt earned handsomely for promoting Ribena at the time.</p><ul><li><strong>TV Presenting, Event Compere</strong></li></ul><p>Her other sources of income include earnings from TV presentations, event hosting, and the likes.
