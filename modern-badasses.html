At one point during the war, she led 7,000 guerilla fighters into a raid of a German gun factory and even killed an SS sentry with her bare hands.

Apparently, it was to become so kick-ass that other warriors begged her to join her expeditions (also to marry them, but nah).

But Inouye wrenched the still-live grenade from the meat of his severed appendage and threw it, destroying the nest.<p>Then he was shot in the leg, so his comrades rushed to help, to which he ordered them back to their posts yelling “Nobody called off the war!"
