But the “Pony” artist ultimately couldn’t resist. “At first I said no, because I’m pretty much a loner type dude, I don’t like to be out in public like that a lot,” he told Variety. “But after a little bit of talking, I ended up saying yes. I wanted to come out of my comfort zone, do something that I hadn’t done.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">And indeed, “The Masked Singer” is unlike anything he or Skid Row frontman Sebastian Bach had ever done. Ginuwine and Bach were revealed on Wednesday as the latest two celebrities to participate in Season 10 of “The Masked Singer.” Ginuwine was the Husky, while Bach was Tiki.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“I love singing, and honestly I saw some really cool friends of mine on the show — namely Dee Snider and Bret Michaels,” Bach said. “I’ve always loved a big production. I just went to the very last Kiss show at Madison Square Garden. And I’ve always loved costumes and make-up and smoke and lights. ‘The Masked Singer’ is definitely a big production with a lot of staging. Before I got on the show, I thought it was more about comedy and the costumes — which it is. But then when I did it, I found out it’s about the singing. I was very happy to be a part of it because I love to sing.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">For Husky, Nicole Scherzinger got it right with Ginuwine, and Robin Thicke agreed. Ken Jeong named Romeo Miller. Jenny McCarthy Wahlberg thought it was Brian McKnight.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“I’m glad I definitely did it,” Ginuwine said. “It was challenging for me as far as the costume because it was truly heavy and hot. I’ve got asthma, and [the costume] dried me out a lot, so I couldn’t sing as I would normally sing outside of a mask. But I was able to get through it once I set my mind, just focus and get it done.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">As for Tiki, Nicole Scherzinger got this one right too, in naming Sebastian Bach. Robin Thicke went with Perry Farrell, Jenny McCarthy Wahlberg named Adam Lambert and Ken Jeong went with Jon Bon Jovi.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“They let me choose, as much as they could, the songs that I was gonna sing,” Bach said. “Which made me happy because I got to do Elton John, “Magic” by Pilot and Lady Gaga. There was a couple other songs that I wanted to sing, but we couldn’t clear them in time. ‘The Final Countdown’ by Europe. I was going to slay you all with that one. I was asking to do some Journey and Led Zeppelin but those were pretty hard to clear.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The singer with the evening’s least number of votes was Ginuwine as Husky. The remaining two contestants facing off in a battle royale (no longer a “smackdown”!) to determine who would move on to the finals, were Tiki and Sea Queen. The two contestants sang their own take on “Nothing But a Good Time,” by Poison.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Bach as Tiki was voted out after that, which means Sea Queen is Group B champion, and will meet Group A champion Cow and Group A “Ding Dong Keep It On” recipient Gazelle in the finals. Next up, the Group C Finals will be between Anteater, Candelabra and Donut.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">It was “I Wanna Rock” night, and Poison frontman Bret Michaels, who previously appeared on the show as the Banana, performed “Nothing But a Good Time” before Tiki and Sea Queen did.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Sebastian Bach as Tiki and Ginuwine as Husky join Ashley Parker Angel as S’more, Metta World Peace as Cuddle Monster, Luann de Lesseps as Hibiscus, Tyler Posey as Hawk, Billie Jean King as Royal Hen, Michael Rapaport as Pickle, Tom Sandoval as Diver, Anthony Anderson as Rubber Ducky and one-time special guest Demi Lovato as Anonymouse as the Season 10 unmasked celebrities so far.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“The Masked Singer” features a new format this season, with three groups followed by Battle Royale semi-final episodes. The season also includes the return of Wild Card contestants, with one Wild Card introduced to each group, and the “Ding Dong Keep It On Bell” is back in the Battle Royale semi-final episodes, where the judges can choose to save one contestant from elimination and move them directly to the finale.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">With sixteen total celebrity singers, Season 10 features new costumes including “Donut,” “Anteater,” “Hawk,” “Hibiscus,” “Diver,” “Gazelle,” “Royal Hen,” “Husky,” “Tiki,” “Pickle,” “Rubber Ducky,” “Candelabra,” “Cow,” “Sea Queen,” “Anonymouse” and a life-size “S’More.” Also returning to mark the show’s 10th are celebrities who have been previously unmasked since the show began. According to the show, Season 10 contestants “boast a combined 40 medals, 33 Grammy nominations, seven hall of fame awards, three lifetime achievement awards and over 50 tattoos.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">The season’s themed episodes will include a tribute to Elton John; a “Trolls Night” tied to the November release of DreamWorks Animation’s “Trolls Band Together”; a “Harry Potter Night” airing the week of Halloween; “NFL Night”; “One Hit Wonders”; “Disco”; “2000s Night”; “I Wanna Rock”; and “Soundtrack of My Life.” Back for Season 10 are host Nick Cannon, alongside panelists Jenny McCarthy Wahlberg, Nicole Scherzinger, Ken Jeong and Robin Thicke.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Here were the other performances on this week’s episode:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/MS-S10_VTR9-Show-TP_00078_f.jpg><h2 class="heading larva // lrv-a-font-accent-m"><strong>Tiki</strong></h2><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Song</strong>: “I Was Made for Lovin’ You,” by Kiss</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Panel guesses: </strong>Sebastian Bach, Perry Farrell, Adam Lambert</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Clue</strong>: (Delivered by Kelly Osbourne) “Japan.” “I had the greatest time in Japan. I actually ran into Nicole Scherzinger there.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Package voiceover</strong>: “Making it into the Group B finals after chugging my competition in the smackdown feels amazing. Especially since it’s rock night. My jam, baby. When I was a kid, my buddy asked me to join the choir. He told me if I got in, I’d get a $3 stipend every month. I said, what’s a stipend? But I knew $3 meant two more Kiss posters. So I auditioned, and because I had a super high-pitched voice, I was made lead soprano. At 8 years old, I hit the road, singing at churches all over. Who’d a thunk I’d be touring the rest of my life? So just goes to show, never pass up an opportunity, because you never know what it will lead you to. And now, finale! Here I come!”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Previous songs: “</strong>Goodbye Yellow Brick Road,” by Elton John; “Magic,” by Pilot</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Previous</strong> <strong>panel guesses: </strong>John Stamos, David Lee Roth, Robert Plant, Dave Grohl, Jon Bon Jovi, Roger Daltry, Robert Plant</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/MS-S10_VTR9-Show-TP_00265_f.jpg><h2 class="heading larva // lrv-a-font-accent-m"><strong>Husky</strong></h2><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Song</strong>: “Always,” by Bon Jovi</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Panel guesses: </strong>DJ D-Wrek.

Sharing the stage with you again is wild.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Package voiceover</strong>: “I’m so thankful to still be here rocking with you in the Group B finals. This has been a wild ride so far, but I wouldn’t change a thing. The loss of my biggest fans, my parents, when they passed away within a year of each other I completely lost my way. I did anything I could to numb the pain. My heart was twisted. But I had to find a way to live without them. I didn’t want my children to hurt the way I was hurting. So I made a change. I’ve always looked at myself as a strong man. But learning to cope in a healthier way took all the grace I have. Now I’ve never been more confident in the Husky I am today. And I know that tenacity will take me into the finale.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Previous song</strong>: “Benny and the Jets,” by Elton John; “Superfreak,” by Rick James</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Previous panel guesses: </strong>Babyface, Terrence Howard, Morris Chestnut, Tank, Ginuwine, Brian McKnight</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/MS-S10_VTR9-Show-TP_00456_f.jpg><h2 class="heading larva // lrv-a-font-accent-m"><strong>Sea Queen</strong></h2><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Song</strong>: “To Be With You,” by Mr. Big</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Panel guesses: </strong>Queen Latifah, Nicey Nash, Macy Gray, Viola Davis</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Clue:</strong> (Presented by Kelly Osbourne). “Co-star.” “I was lucky enough to share the screen with Ken.

And I’m so excited to rock with you all night. Because I was actually in a hard rock band once upon a time. I’ve lived a lot of different experiences. One I will always remember is when I got to co-star with Denzel Washington. I’ve been so surprised by how many Oscar winners I’ve worked with that bring their acting coaches to set! Funny sometimes how you think these big stars have it all figured out. But they’re still trying to learn and improve just like the rest of us. That’s my strategy for making it into the finale. Learn my songs and keep trying to improve as my Sea Queen self!”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Previous song</strong>: “Love Potion No. 9,” by The Searchers</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m"><strong>Previous panel guesses: </strong>Erykah Badu, Queen Latifah, Jennifer Lewis</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“The Masked Singer” is produced by Fox Alternative Entertainment, with James Breen (who is also showrunner), Craig Plestis and Cannon as executive producers.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Snq56qpJa2r7nEp6torJiaeq6t0qScnWWjnruosdFmqp6Zo6S7bn2PZpypoaOksaZ5kGlkq52Tlr1utNSsorJlpJ64qnnRnq2emZyasXA%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fthe-masked-singer-season-10-episode-10-recap-husky-tiki-revealed.html&text=%27The%20Masked%20Singer%27%20Season%2010%2c%20Episode%2010%20Recap%3a%20Husky%2c%20Tiki%20Revealed&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fthe-masked-singer-season-10-episode-10-recap-husky-tiki-revealed.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fthe-masked-singer-season-10-episode-10-recap-husky-tiki-revealed.html&title=%27The%20Masked%20Singer%27%20Season%2010%2c%20Episode%2010%20Recap%3a%20Husky%2c%20Tiki%20Revealed" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fthe-masked-singer-season-10-episode-10-recap-husky-tiki-revealed.html&title=%27The%20Masked%20Singer%27%20Season%2010%2c%20Episode%2010%20Recap%3a%20Husky%2c%20Tiki%20Revealed" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fthe-masked-singer-season-10-episode-10-recap-husky-tiki-revealed.html&title=%27The%20Masked%20Singer%27%20Season%2010%2c%20Episode%2010%20Recap%3a%20Husky%2c%20Tiki%20Revealed" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fthe-masked-singer-season-10-episode-10-recap-husky-tiki-revealed.html&description=%27The%20Masked%20Singer%27%20Season%2010%2c%20Episode%2010%20Recap%3a%20Husky%2c%20Tiki%20Revealed" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./tiktok-human-remains.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="TikTok Teens Discover Human Remains In Luggage On Seattle Beach">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./209953-keyshawn-johnson-started-the-diva-attitude-that-plagues-the-nfl-today.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Keyshawn Johnson Started the Diva Attitude That Plagues the NFL Today | News, Scores, Highlights, St">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
