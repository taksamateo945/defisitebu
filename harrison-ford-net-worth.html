I thought it was good when the description indicated we’d read and discuss plays. I didn’t read the end where it mentioned you have to be in plays, so that was surprising. I was a loner, and this was the first group I felt comfortable with—the usual nerds, misfits, and oddballs of the acting community.”</p><p>He relocated to Los Angeles in 1966 after being hooked on regional theatre. He had other non-speaking and walk-on roles, but they ended. He supported his wife and two sons as a carpenter, working for Joan Didion.
